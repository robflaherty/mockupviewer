# Mockup Viewer

## About
Sometimes when you're presenting mockups you might have a hover state or some simple interaction you want to demo but it's not worth setting up an interactive prototype. This will display your mockups in a browser and let you toggle different states or cycle through them using the 1-9 number keys. You can also use space or right arrow to advance, left arrow to step back.

## How to use
List your images in index.html then cycle through them using 1-9 keys, space bar, or left and right arrows.
